# Specify the output format.
# Options are text, parseable, colorized, json
# Default is text

max-line-length=120

# Disable some Django-specific warnings that are often unnecessary.
disable=
    #C0301: Line too long (handled by max-line-length)
    #C0114: Missing module docstring (Django projects don't always need them)
    #C0115: Missing class docstring (Django models/forms often have implicit documentation)
    #C0116: Missing function or method docstring (similar to above)
    #R0903: Too few public methods (Django models can be simple)
    #W0212: Access to a protected member (Django's internal structure might use this)
    #W0613: Unused argument (Django callbacks might have unused parameters)
    #invalid-name (Django often uses camelCase for models and forms)
    #no-else-return (Sometimes useful to keep the code easier to read)
    #too-many-ancestors (Django inheritance is common and often justified)


[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Adjust the severity level of specific warnings.
# For example, to make "too-many-arguments" an error:
# too-many-arguments=2 # 2 is the warning threshold, above which it becomes an error

# Set the maximum line length (already in [MASTER])
